## By scp4exq

This application has been developed as a final project for UVA CS 4720 - Mobile Application Development
during the Fall 2022 semester.


### API Keys
There are two external APIs being used that must have their respective API keys stored locally 
in different places within the project files.

#### Google Maps
In the ```local.properties``` file in the root directory, include a line like this:  
```MAPS_API_KEY=apikeyhere234545352345```

#### Open Weather
In a new file entitled ```apikey.properties``` in the root directory of the project, include a single line:  
```OW_API_KEY="apikeyhere123345325423"```
